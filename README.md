## Project Name: G3 Architects
## Project Description:
This is a simple HTML & CSS project where I focused on practicing Flexbox, Grid, and CSS Position.
## Note:
The website isn’t responsive. Since my screen resolution is 1600 × 900 pixels, I designed it based on that. If you want to see it properly, you might need to adjust your browser window to match this resolution

## What I newly learned while building this project:
1. While trying to align sections based on the Figma design, I initially used margin: 0 auto; but forgot that it doesn’t work without a fixed width. ChatGPT helped me recall this important rule.

2. When i coding the hero section and quick of our features section i explore a new thing that if i use flex-direction: column;, the align-items property behaves like justify-content, 
   and the justify-content property behaves like align-items.

3. In my previous web_project4, I felt uncomfortable using CSS position properties. However, in this project, I applied positioning in the Features You Will Love & Enjoy Section, and now I feel a bit more confident with it.
